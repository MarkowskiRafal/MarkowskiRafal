## My coding experience

From an early age I was fascinated by technology, science and computers, I was curious about how they work from the programming side. In school, I created simple console applications written in C++ for calculating various things useful in my math classes, because while studying I wanted my own calculator for fun and learning purposes. Later in college, I switched to Java, where I created two larger and more serious projects - a movie theater application and a tournament management application. 
I have been working as a Java developer since August 2021, which is a continuation of my hobby and passion and I am genuinely enthusiastic about learning, and I find joy and satisfaction in the process of development.

After working hours I don't stop exploring the world of Java. I read about the latest trends, study about new technologies and develop my programming skills by solving various tasks from the internet and creating new projects. I believe that systematic learning and solving different tasks is an effective way to develop programming skills and exercise the brain.

## Projects:

#### Car Renting Comparator: | [Repository](https://github.com/MarkowskiRafal/car-renting-comparator-app)

Car Renting Comparator is an application created completely from scratch using tools and practices just as in commercial work. It means that the project has its own board in jira, where tasks are created, which have their statuses, and a backlog, into which ideas
for the development of the application are dropped. On an ongoing basis, documentation is created for each task in confluence. <br /> <br />
I develop this application after working hours during my free time for satisfaction and to fulfill my idea for an application into a real project and to practice my developing skills. <br /> <br />
The ultimate goal is to create an application that facilitates the comparison of offerings from various car rental companies. Unlike many existing sites that focus solely on price, this application aims to allow users to compare specific car details such as brand,
model, horsepower, and more. <br /> <br />
The initial focus is on configuring the application properly, integrating necessary dependencies, setting up an external database, and implementing log4j2 for efficient log collection in a dedicated file. The plan is to utilize the Elastic Stack, including Kibana,
for log visualization. <br /> <br />
The development process involves managing separate branches for distinct tasks, which are then merged into the develop branch, where are tested and deployed into main production branch after successful testing. Each functionality has its own junit
tests and detailed documentation is maintained on Confluence.



## Projects during college:

#### Cinema booking system: | [Repository](https://github.com/MarkowskiRafal/Cinema-booking-system) | Run here: https://kinoteatr-app.herokuapp.com

Cinema booking system is written in Java using Spring Boot, Hibernate and Thymeleaf. This project aimed to broaden the knowledge of programming and the use of my knowledge in 
practice. The main goal was to create a modern application that is functional and fault-tolerant. This application is used to book seats in a cinema. Users can browse the 
repertoire, select a day and time, and then reserve seats. The seats are divided into already reserved and unreserved. All data is stored in the database. Users can register and 
log into the system. Administrator is able to do CRUD operations on movies and screening times. The app was tested on mobile devices.

#### Tournament management: [Repository](https://github.com/MarkowskiRafal/Tournament-management) | Run here: https://tournamentmng.herokuapp.com

There was a local computer game competition between several teams that many students participated in. Everything was done via email, so I thought it would be 
interesting to create an application that would allow organizing such tournaments. Users can submit their teams through the application where each team's score is recorded. The 
administrator has additionally more permissions to this application which he can manage. He also doesn't have to constantly send many emails to everyone. He can add informations 
directly from the application which are visible to everyone. This application allowed me to test and consolidate my programming skills.
