wanted to do for a living.

## Projects

#### Cinema booking system: [Repository](https://github.com/MarkowskiRafal/Cinema-booking-system)

Available at my github repository with readme file and source code.

#### Tournament management: [Repository](https://github.com/MarkowskiRafal/Tournament-management)

In college, there was a local computer game competition between several teams with many students participating. Everything was done via email, so I thought it would be 
interesting to create an app that would allow people to organize tournaments. I am currently working on such an application, in which users can submit their teams to tournaments 
organized in computer games. An administrator could accept teams and set them against each other and update them with wins and losses until the final rounds.
