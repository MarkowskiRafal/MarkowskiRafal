wanted to do for a living.

## Projects

#### Cinema booking system: | [Repository](https://github.com/MarkowskiRafal/Cinema-booking-system) | Run here: https://kinoteatr.app-herokuapp.com |

This application is written in Java using Spring Bot, Hibernate and Thymeleaf that is used to book seats in a cinema. Users can browse the repertoire, 
select a day and time, and then reserve seats. The seats are divided into already reserved and free seats. All data is stored in the database. Users can register and log into 
the system. Administrator is able to do CRUD operations on movies and screening times.

#### Tournament management: [Repository](https://github.com/MarkowskiRafal/Tournament-management)

In college, there was a local computer game competition between several teams with many students participating. Everything was done via email, so I thought it would be 
interesting to create an app that would allow people to organize tournaments. I am currently working on such an application, in which users can submit their teams to tournaments 
organized in computer games. An administrator could accept teams and set them against each other and update them with wins and losses until the final rounds.
