## My coding experience




From an early age I was fascinated by technology, science and computers, I was curious about how they work from the programming side. In school, I created simple console applications written in C++ for calculating various things useful in my math classes, because while studying I wanted my own calculator for fun and learning purposes. Later in college I switched to Jav, and over time my passion for programming has only deepened. I currently work as a Java programmer, which is not only a job for me, but also a way to continue my hobby and passion.

After working hours, I don't stop exploring the world of Java. I read about the latest trends, experiment with different technologies and develop my programming skills. For me, the key element of success is systematic learning and determination. Constantly expanding my knowledge and exploring new areas of programming make every day a new challenge and learning opportunity.

## Projects

#### Cinema booking system: | [Repository](https://github.com/MarkowskiRafal/Cinema-booking-system) | Run here: https://kinoteatr-app.herokuapp.com

Cinema booking system is written in Java using Spring Boot, Hibernate and Thymeleaf. This project aimed to broaden the knowledge of programming and the use of my knowledge in 
practice. The main goal was to create a modern application that is functional and fault-tolerant. This application is used to book seats in a cinema. Users can browse the 
repertoire, select a day and time, and then reserve seats. The seats are divided into already reserved and unreserved. All data is stored in the database. Users can register and 
log into the system. Administrator is able to do CRUD operations on movies and screening times. The app was tested on mobile devices.

#### Tournament management: [Repository](https://github.com/MarkowskiRafal/Tournament-management) | Run here: https://tournamentmng.herokuapp.com

In college, there was a local computer game competition between several teams that many students participated in. Everything was done via email, so I thought it would be 
interesting to create an application that would allow organizing such tournaments. Users can submit their teams through the application where each team's score is recorded. The 
administrator has additionally more permissions to this application which he can manage. He also doesn't have to constantly send many emails to everyone. He can add informations 
directly from the application which are visible to everyone. This application allowed me to test and consolidate my programming skills.
