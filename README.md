## Projects

#### Cinema booking system: | [Repository](https://github.com/MarkowskiRafal/Cinema-booking-system) | Run here: https://kinoteatr-app.herokuapp.com

Cinema booking system is written in Java using Spring Boot, Hibernate and Thymeleaf. This project aimed to broaden the knowledge of programming and the use of my knowledge in 
practice. The main goal was to create a modern application that is functional and fault-tolerant. This application is used to book seats in a cinema. Users can browse the 
repertoire, select a day and time, and then reserve seats. The seats are divided into already reserved and unreserved. All data is stored in the database. Users can register and 
log into the system. Administrator is able to do CRUD operations on movies and screening times. The app was tested on mobile devices.

#### Tournament management: [Repository](https://github.com/MarkowskiRafal/Tournament-management) Run here: https://tournamentmng.herokuapp.com

In college, there was a local computer game competition between several teams that many students participated in. Everything was done via email, so I thought it would be 
interesting to create an application that would allow organizing such tournaments. The administrator would additionally have more permissions to this application, which he could 
manage. He also doesn't have to constantly send many emails to everyone. He can add informations directly from the application which are visible to everyone. This application 
allowed me to test and consolidate my programming skills.
